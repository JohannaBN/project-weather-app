# Weather App

Wanted to build a simple and nice looking weather app for showing the local weather of my home town. Wanted it to be able to show todays weather and a 4-day forecast.

## The problem

The weather data is fetched using an open weather API getting todays weather, time for sunrise and sunset, and a four day forecast for a specific city. The application is built using Javasqript and styled with CSS.
Next step would be to add if/else-statements to be able to change the styling (colours etc.) depending on the fetched weather (sun, snow, rain etc.). Would also like to do a dropdown menu with a copuple of different cities to choose from or more advanced a search bar.
